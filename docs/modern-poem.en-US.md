## My enemy

> Title: It is better to envy other people's lives than to try to make your own life happy.

If I have an enemy,

This enemy is life.

If life gets angry with me,

Living better is the best way to repay life.

If I'm not happy,

Life is bound to secretly laugh at me in the dark corners.

If I live happily,

can make life frustrating,

Can make people who envy my happy life feel ashamed,

If I am ashamed of my life, I will be happy.

Life is uncomfortable,

I'm excited,

Because I let my enemies lose.

## road

There is a road,

can be flat,

can be rough,

It can also be winding,

But no matter what,

The road always has a beginning and an end,

A starting point was chosen,

You can switch directions,

You can stop walking,

anyway,

The end point is yours.

The difference is just that,

happy ending,

Or a regrettable ending.

## A person's coat

Always raise your head and touch the sky:

Touch the whiteness of the clouds,

Touch the limbs of the wind,

Touching the rain's torso,

Then listen carefully to the sky:

Listen to the joy of clouds,

Listen to the trembling of the wind,

Listen to the cry of rain?

Although--

I have touched it,

Already heard it,

but I--

also trembling,

also cry,

also joyful,

I am also immersed in this complicated world.

A nonchalant smile:

Everything is to accompany me,

Put a person's coat on me.

## If your life is not what you want

If your life is not what you want,

Why plow the land of hatred in your heart.

It's better to open up your voice and shout to the sky,

Return life with a happy mood,

Hatred will only consume your life.

Besides, life will not sympathize with you,

They may also hide in dark corners and secretly ridicule you.

Since you are so unhappy,

Let happiness become a newborn baby,

Born into the world again.

## Light and Dark

> Inscription: That day was extremely hot. Looking at the sun, I couldn't help but think...

you,

A moment of brightness,

It was dark for a moment.

I think,

When you look at me brightly,

I look at you darkly.

There is a cat curled up in a carrier -

That was exactly the scenery I was looking forward to.

## Angel in white

The white-clothed immortal has descended into this world,

angelically,

The beautiful phoenix is ashamed,

He is the patron saint of this world.

Those who fall into darkness are trapped by them,

Gave a glimmer of light.

Withered flowers cover them,

Bloom into new life.

This is the patron saint of hope.

The body frozen by this winter,

They are all slowly recovering.

Immersed in the melancholy of this winter,

They all dissipated with a whir.

This is - the patron saint of light.

Because of Bai Yang’s dedication,

There is so much happiness in this world,

Less worries,

Is this a god from heaven?

He is guarding the ordinary on earth.

This is - the ordinary patron saint.

Because there is no retribution for the gushing spring,

Their minds are very, very high.

Everything about them deserves respect.

Is this God's hand?

Protecting the devout believers.

This is - the patron saint of the human world.

The white-clothed immortal has descended into this world,

angelically,

The noble golden dragon lost its nobility,

He is the patron saint of this world.

## Loneliness

Always walking alone on the road of life,

Find a job, travel, or even create your own business.

Believe that you can find a job,

You can achieve your own career.

You can't find a job if you don't believe in yourself,

Nor can he complete his career.

What's so scary about being alone,

The scary thing is my own heart,

A heart of constant self-improvement.

## grandfather

I'm in the ward,

What I saw was you, skinny as a stick.

Needles, tape, very stubborn.

And your weak breathing.

"Are you here?" Three simple words,

It takes all your energy.

At this moment, gold became my God.

Yes, God called you back.

I can travel to a foreign land with peace of mind.

But,

I haven't seen you since then.

I dare not go home,

I dare not see your repaired house.

Because, I really can’t help it——

Grandpa, really!

## the father who sells bacon

In the bustling crowd,

A vicissitudes of life emerged.

Holding an empty frame with both hands,

Like holding a child,

An electronic scale lies like this.

When my father weighed the yellow meat on the electronic scale,

I actually saw it in the smoky barbecue room,

A figure forced to hold back a cough that choked her with tears.

Then his eyes stared intently at the changes in the fresh meat.

Or maybe the smoke is blinding me,

That's why I'm so confused.

In an instant, my whole body was in pain,

I wonder if an electronic scale can weigh the weight of my heart.

Scale, you can weigh the meat,

But I can't express the weight of my heart.

What else in this world can compare to,

What about something heavier?

## Farewell Poem

How can I cut off the love string with one knife,

Make a final farewell.

How to make the tears and blood in my heart,

There is no need to bury one's night.

How to make me forget the past like the wind,

make a final farewell,

How to get rid of the haze in my heart,

There is no need to cover a person's night.

How to make me give up meeting you,

make a final farewell,

How to let go of the bitter hatred in my heart,

No need to engulf one's night.

How to make me wave goodbye to you,

Make a final farewell.

How to let the longing in my heart,

There is no need to lock one's night away.

If life can stay with the first glance,

You won’t taste the sweet and sour taste.

If life could be without a moment of encounter,

You won’t enjoy today’s farewell.

If life can stay with the first glance,

There will be no unforgettable memories.

If life could be without a moment of encounter,

You won't know what this feeling is.
