# Bee

Regardless of whether it is on the plains or on the top of the mountains, it is not difficult to rush there all day long.

After gathering fragrant honey, who can see the infinite scenery?

## Self-translated

Whether on the plains or in the mountains, It didn't feel uncomfortable going back and forth all day long.

When you collect flowers and turn them into nectar, who will appreciate all your hard work?
