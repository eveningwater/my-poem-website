# stumble

Starting from the morning, rushing to chase the wind and dust, the road is dangerous and speeding with all kinds of emotions.

Stumbles are always common, I'm afraid there are no immortals in ancient and modern times.

## Self-translated

I woke up in the morning and ran in a hurry for my hard work. The road was so dangerous. I fell to the ground while riding my bicycle. I had so many insights in that moment.

Falling down or making mistakes is a very common thing. I am afraid that from ancient times to the present, there are no immortals who never make mistakes or fall down.
