# Qi Huai

Who can we catch a glimpse of on another autumn night? The autumn moon has long since disappeared.

You send your love to the bright moon, but you don’t pity me even a star?

## Self-translated

Who can I secretly look at after experiencing the autumn night again? I haven’t seen the bright moon in autumn for a long time.

I still wanted to give the affection in my heart to the bright moon, but there was not even a star in that dark night, let alone the bright moon.
