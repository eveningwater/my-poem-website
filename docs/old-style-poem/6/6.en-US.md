# I feel something when I hear the rat noise at night

There has always been no soul when sleeping, not because of the thunder.

It is expected that this night will be the quietest, and the squeaking sound will startle the dreamer again.

## Self-translated

I always feel like I have lost my soul when I fall into deep sleep. If it were not for the terrible sound of thunder, I would naturally fall asleep.

I expected that tonight would be the quietest time, but I didn't expect that a creaking sound would wake me up again.
