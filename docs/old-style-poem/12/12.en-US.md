# Title "The Boy Moving Bricks"

A small taste of the hardships in the mountains and wilderness, a small amount of time to join the army and battalion commander.

If you are not blessed by others, you will be strong if you are diligent.

## Self-translation

I have experienced the hard work in the mountains since I was a child, and I grew up in a military camp when I was young.

He was born without the same happiness as others, but his hard work made him one of the strongest people in the world.
