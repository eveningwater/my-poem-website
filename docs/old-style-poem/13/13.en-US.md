# Gift to female roommates

> Original title: I heard that female colleagues discussed the couple and lamented the difficulty of having a female child. Suddenly I felt this. There are still couples who grow old together in the world and support each other. How can I make a conclusion?

> I heard a female colleague talk about husband and wife and lamented the difficulties of women, and suddenly I had some thoughts on this. There are still couples in the world who grow old together and support each other. How can we just make a decision and say that it is difficult for women?

It's easy for people to disperse after hearing about Yi's words, but it's hard to feel sorry for her husband even after saying so.

There are thousands of couples in the world, but how can there not be a pair of lotus flowers?

## Self-translated

I heard from a female colleague that couples who love each other easily break up. After saying that, it’s a pity that it’s so difficult for women.

There are so many couples in the world, are there not even one loving couple?
