# I feel it in the rain at night

What I felt suddenly in the rain, I now think about the future.

If Yi's fate is fulfilled, I will swear to death to depend on each other.

## Self-translated

In the drizzle, I suddenly felt something, and now I was thinking about my future.

If I am destined to have that sweetheart, I swear that I will depend on her and live together until my death.
