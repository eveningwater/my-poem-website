# Night Sense

Our hearts are like a gust of wind when we meet each other, why should I betray you for this life?

It's a pity that the first sight was like a dream, but at night the fashion is clear.

## Self-translated

My thoughts are like the wind passing by quickly, just to meet her, why should I let him down?

Unfortunately, it was like a dream when we first met, and it was even clearer when I woke up in the middle of the night.
