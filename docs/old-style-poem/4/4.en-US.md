# FU DE WISHING SONG TO SEND THE NEW COMMENTS

Good fortune accumulated in the past life will lead to good luck in this life.

Hold hands and stay together for thousands of years.

## Self-translated

I have accumulated a lot of goodwill blessings in my previous life, and only then can I get a good fate in this life.

I hope you will hold each other's hands and never be separated until the end of time.

## Self-note

End: end.

Tens of millions of years: refers to a very long time.
