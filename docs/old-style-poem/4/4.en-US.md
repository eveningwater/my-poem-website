# quatrains on Chinese Valentine's Day

The morning glory and the weaver girl come from the Chinese Valentine's Day, and this is the time when joy and sorrow come to an end.

There are no words to say when we say goodbye to each other, only silence is better than missing each other.

## Self-translated

During the Chinese Valentine's Day, the joy of reunion between the Morning Glory and the Weaver Girl and the regret of separation are also at this time.

They will definitely not talk to each other about the mortal past after parting. They just keep silent to each other without speaking, which expresses the emotion of lovesickness.
