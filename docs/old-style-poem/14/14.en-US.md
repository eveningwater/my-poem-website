# Qian Huai

My heart has always been towards the ninth heaven,

There are times when the journey is unknown and difficult.

As soon as I enter the rivers and lakes, I wake up from my dream.

Life is like thousands of mountains.

## Self-translated

I have always longed for a paradise like the Ninth Heaven, and I never knew how difficult the journey would be.

As soon as you enter the world, you begin to wake up. Life is like countless mountains lying in front of you.
