# reminisce

The lights are suddenly as bright as before. Who feels pity for being so desolate and unable to see anything?

It's rare to be as focused as this night, and I don't have time to think about it before I arrive.

## Self-translated

Looking at the lights all over the sky, it's like the past suddenly appears before your eyes. Isn't it a pity that there is nothing to appreciate?

It's rare that I have some thoughts this night, and I won't stop thinking until dawn.
