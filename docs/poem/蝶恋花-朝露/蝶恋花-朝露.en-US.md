# Dielianhua——Morning Dew

The morning dew only needs to be warmed by the red sun. If it is not caused by the heat of the sun, it will only cause stumbling.

The ice and snow are still cold, but the wind and rain make it even colder.

Acquaintance is like falling in love. Between brothers, sincere knowledge can easily be separated.

Looking at the stars and the moon is absurd and will eventually become a fantasy.

# Self-translated

The dew in the morning can be warmed by the hot sunshine. If it is not the hot sun, provoking it will only be a hindrance.

The combination of cold snowflakes and it can only make it even colder. Once there are several storms (referring to conflicts), it will only make each other more upset.

So when we get to know each other, we shouldn't think that it will be like falling in love. After all, we are the same kind of people, and we should really understand that it is easy to break up.

Watching the stars and the moon together at night is a ridiculous thing, and becoming a couple is probably just a wishful thinking!
