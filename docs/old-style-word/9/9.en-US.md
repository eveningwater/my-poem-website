# Sad Painting Fan

Sad for the autumn wind, sad for the painting fan, nothing more sad than seeing it for the first time.

We made a wish that day when we were together, but now our heart has changed.

The bell of resentment, the magpie line of resentment, why is it so hard to hate?

It's half past midnight when Li Shan talks about it, but this hatred will never go away.

## Self-translation

Sad under the autumn wind, sad under the painting fan, the sadness is not as sad as the first time we met.

The vow we made that day to be together forever has now changed with the changing hearts of our old friends.

Is it resentment and misery, or resentment that there is no marriage line? This resentment is difficult to dissipate no matter what.

Thinking about the eternal oath made at the beginning, it has now turned into a bitter hatred that echoes in my heart and will never dissipate.
