# Tianxianzi——Chunjing’s own rhythm

The mountains are green, the clouds are white and the phoenixes are coming, and the people are in a state of spring.

The bitter herbs in front of the door are several feet high and have yellow flower tips. The west wind blows and makes the yellow flowers smile by mistake.

The fragrant grass in the fields cannot be blown down, and the clusters are shaken by wind and rain.

The poet's mind is full of fragrant grass, and the wind is so demonic. People are worried and want to know that their hearts will never grow old.

## Self-translated

The mountains are green, the clouds are pure white, white pigeons are flying, and there are all kinds of houses everywhere. Spring is so beautiful.

The rapeseed in front of the house has grown several feet high, and the yellow flowers hanging horizontally on the rapeseed heads are actually swaying in the strong wind.

The fragrant grass on the edge of the field was not blown by the strong wind, and clusters of it welcomed the arrival of wind and rain, swaying casually.

The poet is worried that the grass will be blown away. The wind is so evil and people are so sad. How can they know that the heart of the grass blown by the wind will not be frightened by the strong wind.
