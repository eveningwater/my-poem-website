# Huan Xi Sha -I am sorry that I am one of them

The sun shines is the first thing to plan for,

Returning to the west and sighing at dusk.

Autumn comes and spring goes, and I am single.

If there is a future like success,

Suddenly I opened my eyes to see the world of mortals,

Also pity me for being one of them.

## Self-translated

The sun shines and I work to survive,

When the sun sets in the west, I return home and lament the dusk alone.

Whether it is spring or autumn, I am always alone.

If you can achieve yourself in the future,

It was as if I suddenly opened my eyes and peered into the world alone,

Only then did I realize that I am actually an ordinary person in this world.
