# Tell your heartfelt feelings

The words are moving, the water is flowing, the heart is very confused, and the thoughts are idle.

I try to look at the sky and see you again, the day is leisurely.

Struggle to be merciless? And shy.

Sending my heart and reassuring yours have already fascinated Yiyan.

## Self-translated

Your words and deeds touched me, making my heart extremely flustered, and I longed for my free play time with you even more.

I often look up at the sky, worrying about the day we will meet again every day.

How could you hold back your emotions? But I am too shy to tell you this love.

I just want to give you my heart and comfort your heart. It turns out that I have become obsessed with everything about you without knowing it.
