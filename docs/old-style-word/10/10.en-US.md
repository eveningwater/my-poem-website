# Busuanzi-I live in Liangshan

I live on Liangshan Mountain, and I live at the bottom of Liangshan Mountain.

I miss her every day without seeing her, and drink the Liangshan water together.

When will this water stop? How long will this hatred last?

I only hope that Yiâ€™s heart will be like my heart and will live up to my expectations.

## Self-translated

I live in Liangshan Mountain, and she lives at the foot of Liangshan Mountain.

I miss her every day but cannot see her, even though we drink water from Liangshan together.

When will the endless river dry up, and when will the bitter hatred of separation cease.

I only hope that your heart will stay as strong as mine, and you will not let down my infatuated feelings.
