# Jiang Chengzi --- Recalling the rain yesterday

When the spring breeze blows away, I feel more worried, and the moon shines brightly, wishing for an autumn. You can complain about the floating water, but donâ€™t understand the competition and flow eastward.

The drizzle flies silently and disperses, flying endlessly, endlessly sad.

The flowers are red, the grass is green, and the night is fragrant, sending fragrance without asking for it. I sigh that life is like a dark cloud.

You won't see everything come to an end when you're drunk. I sincerely wish you could be drunk forever.

## Self-translation

A gust of spring breeze blew, and I felt even more melancholy. The moon was getting brighter and brighter, and another day was about to pass. I really resented the flowing water, and couldn't understand why it only flowed eastward.

The patter of rain fell and dispersed, and what flew down was infinite melancholy.

The flowers are red and the grass is green. This night is so soft. Look at those beautiful flowers, but they are not necessarily what you want. I lament that life is like dark clouds floating in the sky.

If I can't see the end of everything when I'm drunk, then I'd rather have good wine that can keep me drunk.
