# Set the storm

The lone moon is not as bright as the sun, and Ye Feifeng has left no trace.

In autumn, when the green leaves are gone, it will fade away, but when the yellow is everywhere, it is suspected that the gold is competing for the governor?

If the fragrant grass needs to be angry with the earth, I will only see that it has a good head and a good tail.

The wild fire cannot be burned away, and the spring breeze is proud of it.

## Self-translated

The weak light of a lonely moon is not as bright as the sunlight. Under the breeze, the leaves fly leaving traces.

In autumn, the greenery no longer only fades away, but there are withered and yellow leaves everywhere. I suspect they are gold, but I am not sure whether they are.

The green flowers and plants will definitely be angry with the dead leaves on the ground. Just look at them. Even if the fire comes, they will not be able to burn them. They will be even more energetic when the spring breeze blows again.

Therefore, a good beginning and a good ending are both determined by yourself.
