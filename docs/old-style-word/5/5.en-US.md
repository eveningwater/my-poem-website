# Bu Suan Zi-chant subway

Only then do I have some free space, and how much sorrow I feel.

It has always been difficult to know how the body and mind can swim like a tiger squatting?

Everyone is complaining, when will this love end?

It was not suitable to go when they were separated, and the north and the south actually separated.

## Self-translated

After freeing up some free space, a lot of people came in.

I have always known that it is difficult for me to stay entrenched like a tiger, unable to move physically or mentally.

People keep complaining, when will this situation end?

When it was time to leave after standing, it was not suitable to leave because I had mistaken the two directions for getting on and off the bus.
