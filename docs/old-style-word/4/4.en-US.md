# Ta Suo Xing

I don't understand God, there have been many storms, but now the sun has finally gone away.

The falling light burns through life like fire, nothing like the stars and the moon shining brightly.

I, the God of Heaven, answered the question of the road, and this journey will lead to suffering in the future.

Everything in the mortal world comes and goes, and nothing in this world has a life.

## Self-translated

I donâ€™t understand God, there have been several storms, but now the sun is finally shining.

But the sunlight that falls is like fire, scorching the world, not as bright as the stars and the moon.

I want to say that God is trying to tell me that this is a winding road and a hard training for the future.

Everything in this world will come and go in cycles, and there is only one life and it will never stop as time goes by.
