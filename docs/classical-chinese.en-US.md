## The article about offering sacrifices to Dafei brother

Today, Naiweng went to the study hall and said to Yu: "Did you know that your brother Dafei left because of some misfortune?" Yu was shocked and replied: "I don't know yet, why did brother Dafei go?" Naiweng replied: "Why did you go there?" He didn't listen to his mother-in-law's warnings, so he encountered misfortune. You must take this as advice and don't be careless in what you say or do! He has been dead for many days and is in his grave." Yu Zhi's heart was shaken and he wanted to cry. If you don't shed tears, you have no intention of studying.

Thinking back to the past, when Yu Fang was in his infancy and Da Fei's brother had teeth, Yu and Da Fei were born together in Hebei. The rest of Sangzi is definitely the land of Shu, while the rest of Hebei is just for entertainment! It's a pity that I can't remember that time now. When Yu was a child, Brother Dafei was also the same age. Yu and Brother Dafei were playing happily. I still remember climbing a tree and looking at the world from the top, that is, I have a subtle idea of seeing the world. Playing in the stream, walking around in the forest, pursuing the beasts in the world, catching the phoenix flying in the sky, what is beyond words, innocent life, knowing everything in the world, extraordinary things, I and my brother Dafei are having a happy life Alas! Now I can only remember it, how sad it is. When Fang Yu was growing old, Yu Nai and his mother-in-law returned to Shu, and they never saw each other again. Now I have something to say, and I want to complain to others. Who can hear it? Yu Gusi received gold from Yu Youjiaguan to his establishment in 1944, and became his aunt and uncle in Hebei Province. Have you ever thought about hearing about your brother's loss? Yu Shang doesn't know who his brother is. He hasn't seen him for many years and is afraid of being separated. How can he get rid of evil spirits? Wow, now that I heard about my brother's misfortune, I feel really sad. Who can I blame for this? Is it necessary for Brother You not to hesitate to cause evil? Is it especially because of the ruthless nature of heaven? When Nai Weng first told Yu, Yu Cheng didn't believe it, but Nai Weng didn't expect that Cheng was actually evil? Brother, brother, are you evil? Are you motivated by evil spirits? My brother, I only hope that you will be reborn in heaven. If you are reborn, I also hope that you will be reborn in a lucky land.

Alas! Yu Gusi has lived a long life, and it will finally be time to meet his brother. Unexpectedly, my brother passed away. He was only as old as the year he was established! If life is prosperous, the future must be bright. Why go without thinking about the future? I will never see my brother again in this life! Isn’t it sad? Isn’t it painful? Alas! I have countless words to say, but I cannot say them to my brother now. It would be very sad. But now that the matter has come to this, what is left to say? How to do this? I don’t know. When the elder brother leaves, the younger brother cannot go to the funeral, but because the elder brother's family is in Hebei, and the younger brother's family is in Shu, he will go to Yaoyao without knowing how many thousands of miles. When Yu Shang was studying, he could not give up his career and go to Hebei, but he could only study diligently so that he could get gold in the future and look after his brother! Brother, do you know? There is an urgent need in my heart, and I want to go there but there is nothing I can't go to. Is this determined by heaven? Alas! The future is not long. Brother, when you are younger, you will always look to your elder brother.

Heaven and earth are impermanent, just like in a person's life, there will be wind and rain or sunny days, clouds and sunny days, life is also impermanent, just like the road is like a road with twists and turns; from birth to death, we can only follow the laws of heaven and earth, but we cannot double the principles of heaven and earth. My brother's departure is truly an unforeseen event. I don't know what to say, but I only hope that my brother's destiny will be reborn. Alas! Brother, Shang Xiang!

Today, my father came to school and said to me, "Your brother Dafei got into a car accident and passed away. Did you know?" I was surprised and replied, "I still don't know why brother Dafei got into a car accident." And left?" The father replied, "Because he didn't listen to his parents' advice, so he got into a car accident. You must warn yourself about Brother Dafei, and you can't be careful about what you say and do. He has left so far. He will be laid to rest in a few days." My heart was shaken and I wanted to cry but couldn't, and I had no intention of studying.

I think of the past, when I was still an infant and Brother Dafei was just a child. Brother Dafei and I both lived in Hebei. My hometown is originally Sichuan, and I came to Hebei just for fun. It's a pity that now I can't remember my life at that time. I have also reached the age when I was about two or three years old, and my brother Dafei was about eight or nine years old. Brother Dafei and I laughed and played together, and we were always happy. Especially when I think about climbing trees together and looking at the world from the mountains, it’s like seeing how small the world is all at once. Playing in the water, running in the jungle, chasing those small animals, catching those flying birds, how can I finish it? With innocent and simple thoughts, I know everything in the world and some extraordinary things. I and I Brother Dafei spent a happy childhood. But now there are only good memories, how sad it is. Then when I was seven or eight years old, I returned to Sichuan with my parents, and we never saw each other again. Nowadays, I have a lot to say and want to tell others. Who can hear me? I originally thought that when I was between 20 and 30 years old, I would make a lot of money and go to Hebei to visit my brother Dafei, my uncle, and my sister-in-law. Who would have thought of hearing the bad news about Brother Dafei? I don’t know much about Brother Dafei’s appearance. I haven’t seen him for many years, and I’m afraid I’ll feel strange. Brother, how could you leave like this? Hey, now that I heard about my brother’s misfortune, it does make me sad, but who can blame me? Is it because I got it that I blame my brother for not cherishing his own life? Or do you blame God for being ruthless? When my father first told me, I really didn't believe it, but I didn't expect it to be true. Brother, brother, are you in heaven? Are you happy in heaven? Your brother only hopes that you can be happy in heaven. If you are reborn, he also hopes that your brother can be born in a place that brings happiness to him.

Hey, I also thought that there would be a long time in my life, and there would be a time when I would meet my brother, but I didn’t expect that my brother would just pass away. He was probably between eighteen and thirty years old! Life is full of hope and the future is bright. Why do you leave like this without wanting to achieve the future you hope for? I will never see my brother again in this life! Why not make people sad? Why is it not deplorable? Hey, I have countless things to say, but now I can’t tell them to my brother. It’s really sad. But things have reached this point, what can I say? What can I do about what has happened? I don’t know anymore. The elder brother left like this, but the younger brother couldn't go to the funeral, just because the elder brother's home was in Hebei, and the younger brother's home was in Sichuan, and the distance was thousands of miles away. When I was studying, I couldn't give up my studies and go to Hebei. I could only study hard and make money in the future before I could visit my brother. Brother, do you know? My heart is anxious. I want to go to Hebei but I have no choice but to go. Is this what God has destined me to do? Hey, I really hope the future won't be so long. Brother, wait for the younger brother. The eldest brother will definitely come back to visit the older brother.

Everything is changing, as if it controls a person's life. Rainy days or summer, cloudy or sunny, life is constantly changing, just like a bumpy road. When you are born and when you die, you can only rely on God decides, but cannot violate the rules set by heaven and earth. My brother's departure was indeed unexpected, and my younger brother didn't know what to say. I just hoped that my brother could live happily in heaven. Hey, brother, please enjoy the sacrifice.

### Note:

Brother Dafei: My sister-in-law’s son is also my cousin.

##Jiange Travel Notes

The view of nature is the wonder of the world. The view from the sword pavilion seems to be the same for me. On the second day of the first lunar month, Yu and five of his roommates went to Jiange for a tour. Although the body and mind are extremely tired, there is no remaining joy.

At chen o'clock, I and my roommates got up from Xiangxu. At si o'clock, I and my roommates went to Jiange. Along the way, what I could see was the firmness of the green mountains and the dangers of the Shu Road. However, the mountains were green with green grass and trees, and there was no sign of any damage. I and my roommates first entered the beginning. The beginning is the Sword Gate, and the Sword Gate belongs to the Sword Pavilion. Looking at the starting point of Yuli, I was shocked by the danger of Jianmen Mountain, and then I felt curious about it and wanted to climb it.

After a while, Yu and his roommate entered the sword gate. First, Yu and his roommates saw the poem "The Road to Shu is Difficult" written on the wall. The words were sonorous and powerful. Yu and his roommates hesitated for a moment, then slowly moved forward. On Gengwu, Yu and his roommates entered the bell tower. It is said that the bell tower was the home base of Zhong Shiji, but is this true? I don’t know. I and my roommates rested here for a long time, and then started to move forward. One day, when the sky was shining brightly, I knew that it was noon, and I and my roommates were very tired. Although the mountain road was flat and there was a place to rest, it could not relieve the fatigue of Yu and others. However, climbing a mountain is more valuable than perseverance. Everything is waiting for you. If you lose it, how can you achieve the ultimate goal? How could the rest of the group abandon the great scenery out of fatigue and ignore it? Therefore, even after resting for a moment, the rest of the group rose up and continued to move forward. At noon, I and my roommate went to the Fairy Corridor. However, before I stayed here, my roommate wanted to walk on the bird path, but I was startled. However, I didn't have that. Seeing that it was not stopping and moving upwards, I followed it along the bird path. I am afraid of danger, so those who look down at the bird path are always worried about it. Even though I know it can't fall, there are iron ropes blocking it. But when I heard him shouting loudly while looking down from inside, I felt frightened. Bird Taoists, in fact, Taibai clouds can cross the top of Emei, I know it at this time. Although the bird path was in a precarious state, it was still crowded with people, so I and my roommates spent a long time on the bird path. Not long after, I and my roommates walked all the way to the Fairy Bridge, but my roommates didn't feel tired and walked gradually. I chased them again. After walking, the rest of the group arrived at Liangshan Temple. The remaining group arrived at Liangshan Temple. If you want to enter the suspended glass viewing platform, you have to spend money, so the rest of the group did not go and went to Liangshan Temple. The rest of the group just watched here, and then they reached Saishen Cliff. After watching for a moment, they wanted to go to Cuiping Peak. Cuiping Peak was acquired because of its shape resembling Cuiping. When I first looked at it, I thought it was one of the most amazing peaks in the world. The vegetation inside is like grass, and the four seasons are the same, and the vegetation is like a green screen, which is true. At the time of Shen, the rest of the group arrived at the big hole but the small hole. The two holes are like arch bridges, and many people can enter, so it is a wonder. Then the rest of the group will go up the ladder to heaven. The ladder to heaven is also a plank road. Looking down, there is Tianti Gorge. I am afraid of danger and dare not see it again. There is a poem saying that the stairs to the sword pavilion are cold for thousands of miles, and I feel even worse. The ladders and planks are all made of solid wood, and I admire the excellence of the ancients. At the time of You, a group of people went to the Guan Tower. Those who closed the tower were famous for the fact that one man could guard the tower and ten thousand men could not open it. It is said that it was built by Kong Ming, but I don’t know the truth.

In the time of Xu, I returned with my roommates. However, to this day, I am amazed by the Jiange Pavilion. The view from the Jiange Pavilion is a wonder in the world.

The scenery of nature is the most bizarre in the world. I think the scenery of Jianmen Pass is equally strange. On January 2, five friends and I went to Jianmen Pass for fun. Although we were very tired both physically and mentally, It didn't dissipate my happiness.

In the morning, my friends and I started from school. At around 11 o'clock in the morning, my friends and I arrived at Jianmen Pass. Along the way, what I saw were tall and straight green mountains, dangerous roads, and the green flowers, plants and trees in the green mountains, and no trace of wear and tear could be seen. Then my friends and I started to enter the initial place of Jianmenguan, which is Jianmen, which also belongs to Jiange. When I stood at the starting point and looked out, I was immediately shocked by the height of Jianmen Mountain. Then I became curious about Jianmen Mountain and wanted to climb it.

After a while, my friend and I entered the Jianmen Gate. First, my friend and I saw a poem on the stone wall - "The Road to Shu is Difficult". The words on it were very powerful and profound. My friend and I lingered here for a while, and then continued slowly forward to Xin Gongzu. At noon, my friends and I went to the bell tower. It is said that the bell tower was built by the bell society to create a fortress. Isn’t that true? I don't know either. My friend and I rested here for a while and then gradually walked forward. The sun was shining in the sky, and I knew it was already noon. My friends and I both felt tired. Although the mountain road was flat and there were resting places, it could not relieve our fatigue. However, the key to climbing a mountain is perseverance, and the same applies to anything you do. If you give up, how can you reach the top and achieve great things? How could all of us give up the beautiful scenery and not appreciate it because of fatigue? So although we rested for a while, we all got up again and continued walking forward. In the afternoon, my friend and I arrived at the Fairy Corridor, but we did not stay here. My friend wanted to go to the bird path, and I was immediately surprised. However, I was helpless and saw that my friend continued walking up without stopping, so I followed my friend and started walking on the bird path. I'm a little afraid of heights, so I always worry about people walking down the bird path. Although I knew they couldn't fall because there were chains blocking them. Then I heard them standing inside looking down and shouting loudly, feeling very scared in my heart. Bird Road is indeed as its name suggests. Li Bai said it can cross the top of Mount Emei. At this time, I finally understood. Although the bird path is very dangerous, it is still crowded with people, so my friend and I waited at the bird path for a long time. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, my friend and I walked through the bird path and came to Fairy Bridge. However, my friend did not feel tired and gradually walked again. I followed them again and walked for a while. Then we came to Liangshan Temple. Originally We also wanted to go to the suspended glass observation deck, but it would cost money, so we didn’t go and went to Liangshan Temple. We watched here for a while, then arrived at Sheshen Cliff. After watching for a while, we came to Cuiping Peak. Cuiping Peak is called this name because it is shaped like Cuiping. When I first looked at it, I thought It is truly the most bizarre mountain in the world. The flowers, plants and trees inside are dense and the same in all four seasons, and the flowers, plants and trees form a green screen, which is indeed the case. At around five o'clock in the afternoon, we came to the Big Crossing Cave and the Small Crossing Cave. Both of these holes are like arch bridges and can allow several people to enter. They are also a strange scenery. Then we came to the Tianti Ladder. The Tianti Ladder is the plank road. Looking down, we can see the Tianti Gorge. I am afraid of heights. I didn’t dare to look at it a second time after seeing it once. There is a poem that says that the ladder to the sword pavilion is thousands of miles cold, which makes me even more horrified. The ladders and planks are all made of solid wood. I admire the masterpieces of the ancients. At seven o'clock in the evening, we arrived at Guanlou. Guanlou is famous for the fact that one man can guard the gate and ten thousand people can't open it. It is said that it was built by people sent by Kongming. I don't know if it is true.

Around eight o'clock in the evening, my friends and I went home. However, to this day, I am also shocked by Jiange. The scenery of Jiange is really the most bizarre scenery in the world.
