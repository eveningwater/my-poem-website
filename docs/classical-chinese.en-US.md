## The article about offering sacrifices to Dafei brother

Today, Naiweng went to the study hall and said to Yu: "Did you know that your brother Dafei left because of some misfortune?" Yu was shocked and replied: "I don't know yet, why did brother Dafei go?" Naiweng replied: "Why did you go there?" He didn't listen to his mother-in-law's warnings, so he encountered misfortune. You must take this as advice and don't be careless in what you say or do! He has been dead for many days and is in his grave." Yu Zhi's heart was shaken and he wanted to cry. If you don't shed tears, you have no intention of studying.

Thinking back to the past, when Yu Fang was in his infancy and Da Fei's brother had teeth, Yu and Da Fei were born together in Hebei. The rest of Sangzi is definitely the land of Shu, while the rest of Hebei is just for entertainment! It's a pity that I can't remember that time now. When Yu was a child, Brother Dafei was also the same age. Yu and Brother Dafei were playing happily. I still remember climbing a tree and looking at the world from the top, that is, I have a subtle idea of seeing the world. Playing in the stream, walking around in the forest, pursuing the beasts in the world, catching the phoenix flying in the sky, what is beyond words, innocent life, knowing everything in the world, extraordinary things, I and my brother Dafei are having a happy life Alas! Now I can only remember it, how sad it is. When Fang Yu was growing old, Yu Nai and his mother-in-law returned to Shu, and they never saw each other again. Now I have something to say, and I want to complain to others. Who can hear it? Yu Gusi received gold from Yu Youjiaguan to his establishment in 1944, and became his aunt and uncle in Hebei Province. Have you ever thought about hearing about your brother's loss? Yu Shang doesn't know who his brother is. He hasn't seen him for many years and is afraid of being separated. How can he get rid of evil spirits? Wow, now that I heard about my brother's misfortune, I feel really sad. Who can I blame for this? Is it necessary for Brother You not to hesitate to cause evil? Is it especially because of the ruthless nature of heaven? When Nai Weng first told Yu, Yu Cheng didn't believe it, but Nai Weng didn't expect that Cheng was actually evil? Brother, brother, are you evil? Are you motivated by evil spirits? My brother, I only hope that you will be reborn in heaven. If you are reborn, I also hope that you will be reborn in a lucky land.

Alas! Yu Gusi has lived a long life, and it will finally be time to meet his brother. Unexpectedly, my brother passed away. He was only as old as the year he was established! If life is prosperous, the future must be bright. Why go without thinking about the future? I will never see my brother again in this life! Isn’t it sad? Isn’t it painful? Alas! I have countless words to say, but I cannot say them to my brother now. It would be very sad. But now that the matter has come to this, what is left to say? How to do this? I don’t know. When the elder brother leaves, the younger brother cannot go to the funeral, but because the elder brother's family is in Hebei, and the younger brother's family is in Shu, he will go to Yaoyao without knowing how many thousands of miles. When Yu Shang was studying, he could not give up his career and go to Hebei, but he could only study diligently so that he could get gold in the future and look after his brother! Brother, do you know? There is an urgent need in my heart, and I want to go there but there is nothing I can't go to. Is this determined by heaven? Alas! The future is not long. Brother, when you are younger, you will always look to your elder brother.

Heaven and earth are impermanent, just like in a person's life, there will be wind and rain or sunny days, clouds and sunny days, life is also impermanent, just like the road is like a road with twists and turns; from birth to death, we can only follow the laws of heaven and earth, but we cannot double the principles of heaven and earth. My brother's departure is truly an unforeseen event. I don't know what to say, but I only hope that my brother's destiny will be reborn. Alas! Brother, Shang Xiang!

### Self-translated

Today, my father came to school and said to me, "Your brother Dafei got into a car accident and passed away. Did you know?" I was surprised and replied, "I still don't know why brother Dafei got into a car accident." And left?" The father replied, "Because he didn't listen to his parents' advice, so he got into a car accident. You must warn yourself about Brother Dafei, and you can't be careful about what you say and do. He has left so far. He will be laid to rest in a few days." My heart was shaken and I wanted to cry but couldn't, and I had no intention of studying.

I think of the past, when I was still an infant and Brother Dafei was just a child. Brother Dafei and I both lived in Hebei. My hometown is originally Sichuan, and I came to Hebei just for fun. It's a pity that now I can't remember my life at that time. I have also reached the age when I was about two or three years old, and my brother Dafei was about eight or nine years old. Brother Dafei and I laughed and played together, and we were always happy. Especially when I think about climbing trees together and looking at the world from the mountains, it’s like seeing how small the world is all at once. Playing in the water, running in the jungle, chasing those small animals, catching those flying birds, how can I finish it? With innocent and simple thoughts, I know everything in the world and some extraordinary things. I and I Brother Dafei spent a happy childhood. But now there are only good memories, how sad it is. Then when I was seven or eight years old, I returned to Sichuan with my parents, and we never saw each other again. Nowadays, I have a lot to say and want to tell others. Who can hear me? I originally thought that when I was between 20 and 30 years old, I would make a lot of money and go to Hebei to visit my brother Dafei, my uncle, and my sister-in-law. Who would have thought of hearing the bad news about Brother Dafei? I don’t know much about Brother Dafei’s appearance. I haven’t seen him for many years, and I’m afraid I’ll feel strange. Brother, how could you leave like this? Hey, now that I heard about my brother’s misfortune, it does make me sad, but who can blame me? Is it because I got it that I blame my brother for not cherishing his own life? Or do you blame God for being ruthless? When my father first told me, I really didn't believe it, but I didn't expect it to be true. Brother, brother, are you in heaven? Are you happy in heaven? Your brother only hopes that you can be happy in heaven. If you are reborn, he also hopes that your brother can be born in a place that brings happiness to him.

Hey, I also thought that there would be a long time in my life, and there would be a time when I would meet my brother, but I didn’t expect that my brother would just pass away. He was probably between eighteen and thirty years old! Life is full of hope and the future is bright. Why do you leave like this without wanting to achieve the future you hope for? I will never see my brother again in this life! Why not make people sad? Why is it not deplorable? Hey, I have countless things to say, but now I can’t tell them to my brother. It’s really sad. But things have reached this point, what can I say? What can I do about what has happened? I don’t know anymore. The elder brother left like this, but the younger brother couldn't go to the funeral, just because the elder brother's home was in Hebei, and the younger brother's home was in Sichuan, and the distance was thousands of miles away. When I was studying, I couldn't give up my studies and go to Hebei. I could only study hard and make money in the future before I could visit my brother. Brother, do you know? My heart is anxious. I want to go to Hebei but I have no choice but to go. Is this what God has destined me to do? Hey, I really hope the future won't be so long. Brother, wait for the younger brother. The eldest brother will definitely come back to visit the older brother.

Everything is changing, as if it controls a person's life. Rainy days or summer, cloudy or sunny, life is constantly changing, just like a bumpy road. When you are born and when you die, you can only rely on God decides, but cannot violate the rules set by heaven and earth. My brother's departure was indeed unexpected, and my younger brother didn't know what to say. I just hoped that my brother could live happily in heaven. Hey, brother, please enjoy the sacrifice.

### Note:

Brother Dafei: My sister-in-law’s son is also my cousin.
