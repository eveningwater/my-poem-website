# Angel in white

The white-clothed immortal has descended into this world,

angelically,

The beautiful phoenix is ashamed,

He is the patron saint of this world.

Those who fall into darkness are trapped by them,

Gave a glimmer of light.

Withered flowers cover them,

Bloom into new life.

This is the patron saint of hope.

The body frozen by this winter,

They are all slowly recovering.

Immersed in the melancholy of this winter,

They all dissipated with a whir.

This is - the patron saint of light.

Because of Bai Yangâ€™s dedication,

There is so much happiness in this world,

Less worries,

Is this a god from heaven?

He is guarding the ordinary on earth.

This is - the ordinary patron saint.

Because there is no retribution for the gushing spring,

Their minds are very, very high.

Everything about them deserves respect.

Is this God's hand?

Protecting the devout believers.

This is - the patron saint of the human world.

The white-clothed immortal has descended into this world,

angelically,

The noble golden dragon lost its nobility,

He is the patron saint of this world.
