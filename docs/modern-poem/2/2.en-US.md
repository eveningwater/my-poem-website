# road

There is a road,

can be flat,

can be rough,

It can also be winding,

But no matter what,

The road always has a beginning and an end,

A starting point was chosen,

You can switch directions,

You can stop walking,

anyway,

The end point is yours.

The difference is just that,

happy ending,

Or a regrettable ending.
