I'm in the ward,

What I saw was you, skinny as a stick.

Needles, tape, very stubborn.

And your weak breathing.

"Are you here?" Three simple words,

It takes all your energy.

At this moment, gold became my God.

Yes, God called you back.

I can travel to a foreign land with peace of mind.

But,

I haven't seen you since then.

I dare not go home,

I dare not see your repaired house.

Because, I really can’t help it——

Grandpa, really!
