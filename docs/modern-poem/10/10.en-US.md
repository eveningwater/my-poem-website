# the father who sells bacon

In the bustling crowd,

A vicissitudes of life emerged.

Holding an empty frame with both hands,

Like holding a child,

An electronic scale lies like this.

When my father weighed the yellow meat on the electronic scale,

I actually saw it in the smoky barbecue room,

A figure forced to hold back a cough that choked her with tears.

Then his eyes stared intently at the changes in the fresh meat.

Or maybe the smoke is blinding me,

That's why I'm so confused.

In an instant, my whole body was in pain,

I wonder if an electronic scale can weigh the weight of my heart.

Scale, you can weigh the meat,

But I can't express the weight of my heart.

What else in this world can compare to,

What about something heavier?
