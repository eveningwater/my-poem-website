# Farewell Poem

How can I cut off the love string with one knife,

Make a final farewell.

How to make the tears and blood in my heart,

There is no need to bury one's night.

How to make me forget the past like the wind,

make a final farewell,

How to get rid of the haze in my heart,

There is no need to cover a person's night.

How to make me give up meeting you,

make a final farewell,

How to let go of the bitter hatred in my heart,

No need to engulf one's night.

How to make me wave goodbye to you,

Make a final farewell.

How to let the longing in my heart,

There is no need to lock one's night away.

If life can stay with the first glance,

You won’t taste the sweet and sour taste.

If life could be without a moment of encounter,

You won’t enjoy today’s farewell.

If life can stay with the first glance,

There will be no unforgettable memories.

If life could be without a moment of encounter,

You won't know what this feeling is.
