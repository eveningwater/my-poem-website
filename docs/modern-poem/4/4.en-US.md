# If your life is not what you want

If your life is not what you want,

Why plow the land of hatred in your heart.

It's better to open up your voice and shout to the sky,

Return life with a happy mood,

Hatred will only consume your life.

Besides, life will not sympathize with you,

They may also hide in dark corners and secretly ridicule you.

Since you are so unhappy,

Let happiness become a newborn baby,

Born into the world again.
