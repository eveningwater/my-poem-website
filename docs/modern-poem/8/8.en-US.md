# Loneliness

Always walking alone on the road of life,

Find a job, travel, or even create your own business.

Believe that you can find a job,

You can achieve your own career.

You can't find a job if you don't believe in yourself,

Nor can he complete his career.

What's so scary about being alone,

The scary thing is my own heart,

A heart of constant self-improvement.
