# My enemy

> Title: It is better to envy other people's lives than to try to make your own life happy.

If I have an enemy,

This enemy is life.

If life gets angry with me,

Living better is the best way to repay life.

If I'm not happy,

Life is bound to secretly laugh at me in the dark corners.

If I live happily,

can make life frustrating,

Can make people who envy my happy life feel ashamed,

If I am ashamed of my life, I will be happy.

Life is uncomfortable,

I'm excited,

Because I let my enemies lose.
