# A person's coat

Always raise your head and touch the sky:

Touch the whiteness of the clouds,

Touch the limbs of the wind,

Touching the rain's torso,

Then listen carefully to the sky:

Listen to the joy of clouds,

Listen to the trembling of the wind,

Listen to the cry of rain?

Although--

I have touched it,

Already heard it,

but I--

also trembling,

also cry,

also joyful,

I am also immersed in this complicated world.

A nonchalant smile:

Everything is to accompany me,

Put a person's coat on me.
