## Dielianhua—Morning Dew

The morning dew only needs to be warmed by the red sun. If it is not caused by the heat of the sun, it will only cause stumbling.

The ice and snow are still cold, but the wind and rain make it even colder.

Acquaintance is like falling in love. Between brothers, sincere knowledge can easily be separated.

Looking at the stars and the moon is absurd and will eventually become a fantasy.

### Self-translated

The dew in the morning can be warmed by the hot sunshine. If it is not the hot sun, provoking it will only be a hindrance.

The combination of cold snowflakes and it can only make it even colder. Once there are several storms (referring to conflicts), it will only make each other more upset.

So when we get to know each other, we shouldn't think that it will be like falling in love. After all, we are the same kind of people, and we should really understand that it is easy to break up.

Watching the stars and the moon together at night is a ridiculous thing, and becoming a couple is probably just a wishful thinking!

## Express your feelings

The words are moving, the water is flowing, the heart is very confused, and the thoughts are idle.

I try to look at the sky and see you again, the day is leisurely.

Struggle to be merciless? And shy.

Sending my heart and reassuring yours have already fascinated Yiyan.

### Self-translated

Your words and deeds touched me, making my heart extremely flustered, and I longed for my free play time with you even more.

I often look up at the sky, worrying about the day we will meet again every day.

How could you hold back your emotions? But I am too shy to tell you this love.

I just want to give you my heart and comfort your heart. It turns out that I have become obsessed with everything about you without knowing it.

## Tasha Xing

I don't understand God, there have been many storms, but now the sun has finally gone away.

The falling light burns through life like fire, nothing like the stars and the moon shining brightly.

I, the God of Heaven, answered the question of the road, and this journey will lead to suffering in the future.

Everything in the mortal world comes and goes, and nothing in this world has a life.

### Self-translated

I don’t understand God, there have been several storms, but now the sun is finally shining.

But the sunlight that falls is like fire, scorching the world, not as bright as the stars and the moon.

I want to say that God is trying to tell me that this is a winding road and a hard training for the future.

Everything in this world will come and go in cycles, and there is only one life and it will never stop as time goes by.

## Bu Suanzi-Yong Subway

Only then do I have some free space, and how much sorrow I feel.

It has always been difficult to know how the body and mind can swim like a tiger squatting?

Everyone is complaining, when will this love end?

It was not suitable to go when they were separated, and the north and the south actually separated.

### Self-translated

After freeing up some free space, a lot of people came in.

I have always known that it is difficult for me to stay entrenched like a tiger, unable to move physically or mentally.

People keep complaining, when will this situation end?

When it was time to leave after standing, it was not suitable to leave because I had mistaken the two directions for getting on and off the bus.

## Bodhisattva Man-titled for "Cherish life and reject drugs"

Poison is truly an evil in the world, turned into a nightmare and intoxicating.

It's not easy to look back, as if I was lost in my own daughter.

Life and death can be decided, who knows the danger?

I advise you to cherish life and not to enter dangerous situations.

### Self-translated

Drugs are really the most evil thing in the world. It is like turning into a terrible dream that makes people indulge in it and feel happy.

She won't turn people back easily, just like she is infatuated with the most beautiful woman.

Life and death are only decided in a moment. Who can know the dangers involved?

I advise everyone to cherish life and not put yourself in an obviously dangerous situation.

## Huanxisha-I feel pity that I am one of them

Rizhao is the first thing to plan for,

Returning to the west and sighing at dusk.

Autumn comes and spring goes, and I am single.

If there is a future like Ji Di,

Suddenly I opened my eyes to see the world of mortals,

Also pity me for being one of them.

### Self-translated

The sun shines and I work to survive,

When the sun sets in the west, I return home and lament the dusk alone.

Whether it is spring or autumn, I am always alone.

If you can achieve yourself in the future,

It was as if I suddenly opened my eyes and peered into the world alone,

Only then did I realize that I am actually an ordinary person in this world.

## Tianxianzi——Chunjing’s own rhythm

The mountains are green, the clouds are white and the phoenixes are coming, and the people are in a state of spring.

The bitter herbs in front of the door are several feet high and have yellow flower tips. The west wind blows and makes the yellow flowers smile by mistake.

The fragrant grass in the fields cannot be blown down, and the clusters are shaken by wind and rain.

The poet's mind is full of fragrant grass, and the wind is so demonic. People are worried and want to know that their hearts will never grow old.

### Self-translated

The mountains are green, the clouds are pure white, white pigeons are flying, and there are all kinds of houses everywhere. Spring is so beautiful.

The rapeseed in front of the house has grown several feet high, and the yellow flowers hanging horizontally on the rapeseed heads are actually swaying in the strong wind.

The fragrant grass on the edge of the field was not blown by the strong wind, and clusters of it welcomed the arrival of wind and rain, swaying casually.

The poet is worried that the grass will be blown away. The wind is so evil and people are so sad. How can they know that the heart of the grass blown by the wind will not be frightened by the strong wind.

## Jiangchengzi---recalling what the rain sent yesterday

When the spring breeze blows away, I feel more worried, and the moon shines brightly, wishing for an autumn. You can complain about the floating water, but don’t understand the competition and flow eastward.

The drizzle flies silently and disperses, flying endlessly, endlessly sad.

The flowers are red, the grass is green, and the night is fragrant, sending fragrance without asking for it. I sigh that life is like a dark cloud.

You won't see everything come to an end when you're drunk. I sincerely wish you could be drunk forever.

### Self-translated

A gust of spring breeze blew, and I felt even more melancholy. The moon was getting brighter and brighter, and another day was about to pass. I really resented the flowing water, and couldn't understand why it only flowed eastward.

The patter of rain fell and dispersed, and what flew down was infinite melancholy.

The flowers are red and the grass is green. This night is so soft. Look at those beautiful flowers, but they are not necessarily what you want. I lament that life is like dark clouds floating in the sky.

If I can't see the end of everything when I'm drunk, then I'd rather have good wine that can keep me drunk.

## Sad painted fan

Sad for the autumn wind, sad for the painting fan, nothing more sad than seeing it for the first time.

We made a wish that day when we were together, but now our heart has changed.

The bell of resentment, the magpie line of resentment, why is it so hard to hate?

It's half past midnight when Li Shan talks about it, but this hatred will never go away.

### Self-translated

Sad under the autumn wind, sad under the painting fan, the sadness is not as sad as the first time we met.

The vow we made that day to be together forever has now changed with the changing hearts of our old friends.

Is it resentment and misery, or resentment that there is no marriage line? This resentment is difficult to dissipate no matter what.

Thinking about the eternal oath made at the beginning, it has now turned into a bitter hatred that echoes in my heart and will never dissipate.

## Bu Suanzi-I live in Liangshan

I live on Liangshan Mountain, and I live at the bottom of Liangshan Mountain.

I miss her every day without seeing her, and drink the Liangshan water together.

When will this water stop? How long will this hatred last?

I only hope that Yi’s heart will be like my heart and will live up to my expectations.

### Self-translated

I live in Liangshan Mountain, and she lives at the foot of Liangshan Mountain.

I miss her every day but cannot see her, even though we drink water from Liangshan together.

When will the endless river dry up, and when will the bitter hatred of separation cease.

I only hope that your heart will stay as strong as mine, and you will not let down my infatuated feelings.

## Set the new tone

The lone moon is not as bright as the sun, and Ye Feifeng has left no trace.

In autumn, when the green leaves are gone, it will fade away, but when the yellow is everywhere, it is suspected that the gold is competing for the governor?

If the fragrant grass needs to be angry with the earth, I will only see that it has a good head and a good tail.

The wild fire cannot be burned away, and the spring breeze is proud of it.

### Self-translated

The weak light of a lonely moon is not as bright as the sunlight. Under the breeze, the leaves fly leaving traces.

In autumn, the greenery no longer only fades away, but there are withered and yellow leaves everywhere. I suspect they are gold, but I am not sure whether they are.

The green flowers and plants will definitely be angry with the dead leaves on the ground. Just look at them. Even if the fire comes, they will not be burned. They will be even more energetic when the spring breeze blows again.

Therefore, a good beginning and a good ending are both determined by yourself.

## Teasing Order-Falling Leaves

Danye, Danye,

The swirling spring sun is bleak.

Desolate, desolate,

The setting sun is also the bright moon.

### Self-translated

Red fallen leaves, red fallen leaves,

They are flying down one after another, suggesting the desolation of spring.

The desolation of spring, the desolation of spring,

It makes me feel like the falling sun has turned into a bright moon.

### Self-note

The last sentence uses two images, comparing the setting sun to the bright moon, to express my homesickness. Because it was written at dusk, in spring, you can actually see fallen leaves. I wrote it with emotion, and also lamented the rapid passage of time. Affection.
